# Day 1 — HTML & CSS Foundations

## 📌 Work Summary

On Day 1, we focused on building a strong foundation in **web development fundamentals**.  
The session began with understanding how the web works, followed by hands-on implementation of **HTML structure** and **CSS styling**.

Students created their first structured web page using semantic HTML and enhanced it with basic CSS to understand layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy. The goal was not just to write code, but to understand **why each piece exists** and how browsers interpret it.

## 🧠 Learnings & Outcomes

By the end of Day 1, learners were able to:

- Understand how browsers process HTML and CSS
- Create a basic HTML document structure
- Use semantic HTML tags such as `header`, `section`, and `footer`
- Apply CSS for layout, spacing, and basic styling
- Use Flexbox to align elements horizontally and vertically
- Build a simple but realistic landing page layout

More importantly, students developed a **mental model of the web**, understanding that:
> HTML defines structure, and CSS defines presentation.

## ⚠️ Blockers & Risks

### Blockers
- Initial unfamiliarity with development tools like VS Code
- Confusion between similar concepts such as margin vs padding
- Understanding Flexbox alignment directions (row vs column)

### Risks
- Skipping semantic HTML and overusing generic `div` elements
- Styling without proper structure, leading to layout issues
- Relying on trial-and-error instead of understanding CSS fundamentals

These were addressed through live explanations and visual demonstrations.
