## 🧠 Work Summary

Day 3 focused on transitioning students from **logic-first JavaScript** to **data-driven application thinking**, which forms the foundation of real-world frontend development.

Students moved beyond hard-coded values and static HTML into working with **structured data**, learning how modern applications store, transform, filter, and render information dynamically. A strong emphasis was placed on understanding that **UI is derived from data**, not manually written or copy-pasted.

Key concepts covered included arrays, objects, arrays of objects, functional methods like `map()` and `filter()`, ES6 syntax improvements, and introductory object-oriented programming using classes and constructors. The day concluded with a guided refactor to demonstrate how **production-quality code evolves over time**.

This session intentionally mirrored how frontend engineers think and work in real-world industry environments.

## 🎯 Learnings & Outcomes

By the end of Day 3, students were able to structure application data using arrays and objects, represent real-world entities using classes, and dynamically generate UI elements from data instead of hard-coding HTML.

They learned how to transform and selectively display data using `map()` and `filter()`, write cleaner and more readable ES6-style JavaScript, and refactor working code into more maintainable and scalable structures. Students also developed an understanding of how modern frontend frameworks internally rely on the same core principles introduced during this session.

## ⚠️ Blockers & Risks

Common challenges and risks identified during Day 3 include:

- Confusion between arrays vs objects and when to use each
- Forgetting to return values inside `map()` or `filter()`
- Treating UI as the source of truth instead of data
- Misunderstanding `this` inside classes and constructors
- Overusing ES6 syntax without understanding intent
- Difficulty visualizing how data flows into UI

Students are encouraged to focus on **clarity over cleverness** and prioritize readable, maintainable code.
