## 🧠 Work Summary

Day 2 focused on introducing **JavaScript as the logic layer of the web** and guiding students from static pages into **interactive, event-driven applications**.

The day began by establishing **why JavaScript exists**, clearly separating responsibilities between:

- **HTML** — structure  
- **CSS** — presentation  
- **JavaScript** — behavior & logic  

Students learned how JavaScript runs in the browser, how it reacts to user actions through **events**, and how it controls the page using the **DOM (Document Object Model)**.

Core programming foundations were covered, including:
- Variables (`let`, `const`)
- Data types
- Operators
- Basic logic
- Functions  

Strong emphasis was placed on **thinking like a developer**—understanding memory, conditions, decisions, and reusable logic rather than memorizing syntax.

The second half of the day connected JavaScript to the UI through **DOM selection**, **event handling**, and **state changes**. Students built real, confidence-building features such as:

- A **Battery Range Calculator**
- A **Dark Mode toggle**
- Interactive UI updates using events

The day concluded with a strong focus on **debugging**, teaching students how to use the browser console, read errors, and treat bugs as **feedback rather than failure**.

## 🎓 Learnings & Outcomes

By the end of Day 2, students developed a strong mental model of **how JavaScript works in the browser** and how real web applications are structured. They learned how to store and manipulate data using variables, apply logic through operators and conditions, and organize behavior using functions.

Students were able to connect JavaScript to HTML via the DOM, respond to user interactions using events, and update the UI dynamically. Most importantly, they gained confidence in building small but real features and learned how to debug their own code using the browser console.

## ⚠️ Blockers & Risks

Common challenges students may face after Day 2 include:

- Confusing `console.log()` with returning values from functions
- Forgetting that JavaScript is **event-driven** and does nothing unless triggered
- Misunderstanding `null` errors due to incorrect DOM selectors
- Mixing logic directly inside event handlers instead of using functions
- Typos in IDs or class names causing DOM selection failures
- Feeling overwhelmed by error messages instead of reading them carefully

These risks were addressed during the day by reinforcing debugging habits and logical thinking.
